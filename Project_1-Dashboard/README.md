## Introduction

This job salary dashboard enables job seekers to explore different job salaries of their ideal jobs. From the dashboard, users can select a job title, country, and job type of their choice in order for the charts to produce that combination's results, and to compute the combination's median salary, top job platform, and job count.

From the dashboard diagram above, the job title "Data Analyst", the country "United States", and the job type "Full-time" were selected to produce the resulting charts, and to compute the median salary as $90,000, the top job platform as Indeed, and the job count as 6,480.

The dataset used was from Luke Barousse's Excel course, which has information about the different job postings that include the job title, yearly/hourly salary, job location, and the job type. Excel is a powerful tool not only for analyzing data but to also create this dashboard.
