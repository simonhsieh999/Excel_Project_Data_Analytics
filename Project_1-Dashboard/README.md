## Introduction

This job salary dashboard allowed job seekers to select a job title, country, and job type of their choice in order to explore that combination's median salary, top job platform, and job count in order to make decisions during their job search. The dataset used was from Luke Barousse's Excel course, which has information about the different job postings that include the job title, yearly/hourly salary, job location, and the job type. Excel is a powerful tool not only for analyzing data but to also create this dashboard.
