# Excel Project Data Analytics

Hello everyone! 

Here are 2 Excel projects I have done from [Luke Barousse's "Excel For Data Analytics" course](https://github.com/lukebarousse/Excel_Data_Analytics_Course). They are both about analyzing job salary data of different job postings to help job seekers explore the different salaries of different job titles, and to find the most optimal job. All of the datasets used are from Luke's course.

### 1st Project
For the 1st project, I have created a dashboard (as shown below) that allows us to select the job title, country, and job type in order to find its median salary, top job platform, and job count. Here is the link to the project: [Salary Dashboard](https://github.com/simonhsieh999/Excel_Project_Data_Analytics/tree/main/Project_1-Dashboard)

### 2nd Project

For the 2nd project, I have used the advanced Excel tools PowerQuery and PowerPivot to analyze the job salary data.


Go ahead and check out the 2 Excel projects!
