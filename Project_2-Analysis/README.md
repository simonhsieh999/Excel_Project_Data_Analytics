# Project 2 Analysis

## Introduction

For this analysis, I investigated the job skills data from the job postings to figure out what are the most valuable skills for data jobs that will improve the chances of getting hired for a high paying data job. I did that by analyzing the following:  

**1. Does acquiring more skills lead to a higher salary?**  
**2. What are the median data job salaries in different countries?**  
**3. What are the top skills for data professionals?**  
**4. What is the salary for the top 10 skills?**  

### Dataset And Excel Tools Used

The [dataset](https://github.com/simonhsieh999/Excel_Project_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Project_2-Analysis/data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx) used is the same as the one from project 1, which contains information about 32,673 job postings that include:
* Job Titles
* Yearly and Hourly Salaries
* Locations
* Skills

However, I used different Excel tools for the analysis that include:
* Pivot Tables
* Pivot Charts
* Power Query
* Power Pivot
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
