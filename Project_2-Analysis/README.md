# Project 2 Analysis

## Introduction

For this project, I investigated the job skills data from the job postings to figure out what are the most valuable skills for data jobs that will improve the chances of getting hired for a high paying data job. I did that by analyzing the following:  

**1. Does acquiring more skills lead to a higher salary?**  
**2. What are the median data job salaries in different countries?**  
**3. What are the top skills for data professionals?**  
**4. What is the salary for the top 10 skills?**  

### Dataset And Excel Tools Used

The [dataset](https://github.com/simonhsieh999/Excel_Project_Data_Analytics/blob/main/Project_2-Analysis/data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx) used is the same as the one from project 1, which contains information about 32,673 job postings that include:
* Job Titles
* Yearly and Hourly Salaries
* Locations
* Skills

However, I used different Excel tools for the analysis, which include:
* Pivot Tables
* Pivot Charts
* Power Query
* Power Pivot
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Does acquiring more skills lead to a higher salary?

For this analysis, I used Power Query, which is an efficient data manipulation tool used to extract, transform, and load data. The following steps were performed in Power Query:

### Extract

The orginal data from the `data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx` file was first extracted onto a blank Excel sheet using the "Get Data" option from the "Data" tab. Then, 2 queries were created: One for the data jobs information, and one for the skills for each job.

### Transform
